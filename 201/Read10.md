# Debugging

> ## Troublshooting JavaScript

* Syntax errors
: Spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through.

* Logic errors
: Errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be.


### Questions

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
   * Syntax error cause the program not to work at all but will provide you with a message as to what the issue might be. Logic errors is where the code is correct but its not what you intended. Also it does not give you a message of whats wrong making it harder to find the issue.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
   * I mainly had a lot of syntax errors. I solved them by looking at the message to get an idea of where i need to start to fix it. Also google helped a lot.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
   * It will continue to influence my long term goals by helping me figure out what is wrong with my code. Also, how i can fix it or troubleshoot what is wrong.

### Questions

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
   * Think of it as mini golf. when you hit the ball. Thats you starting the debugger tool. Now you want the ball to go from point a to point b. However, there are some obstacles that prevent your ball going in a stright line. Thats the error code debugger is showing. You need to fix that and get that obstacle out your way so your ball can continue to roll straight if you were to reset and hit it again.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
   * A set point you place to pause execution

3. What is the call stack?
   * Call stack shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
