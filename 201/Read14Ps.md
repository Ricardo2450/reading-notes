# Read 14- Psychological Safety

In this reading, we look at a project called Aristotle. It was a project that google created in order to figure out what made the best work group. Was it just putting the best and brightest people together or could you put any random person together to make it work. It took over three years of studies and what they found out was it came down to the group norms. Not just that, the groups that did well together had establish a psychologically safe environments. Basically, instead of having one or a small group talk about there ideas. Everyone gets a chance to speak without feeling like what they have to say sucks. When that happens, it leads to a better work environment. So to have the best possible work environment with your group mates, treat everyone fairly and don't discourage what they have to say.
