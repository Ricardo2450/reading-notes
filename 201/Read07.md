# Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

> ## Domain Modeling

### Questions

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
   * You can create a conceptual model for a specific problem. Than verify and validate your understanding of that problem.

> ## HTML Table Basics

### Questions

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
   * Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users. Also, Tables are not automatically responsive.

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML \<table>
   * \<td> (stands for table data)
   : It's the smallest container inside a table is a table cell. Creates a single cell and together they make up the first row. Every cell we add makes the row grow longer.
   * \<tr> (stands for table row)
   : Stops the 'td' row from growing and starts placing subsequent cells on a second row
   * \<th> element ('th' stands for 'table header')
  : special cells that go at the start of a row or column and define the type of data that row or column contains.

> ## Introducing Constructors

### Questions

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
   * A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. Some advantages are it will create a new object, bind this to new object, and run the code in the constructor.

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
   * It dont really differ between the two. However, when you create more than one object literal. This enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create. Same with a Constructor.

> ## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

### Questions

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
   * prototypes are the different locations I did in my Salmon and cookie project. By creating an object for each location and passing along different variables we can pug in. That location will inheritance all that info.

> ## Things I want to know more about
* using .prototype in my code
* hasOwnProperty in code.
