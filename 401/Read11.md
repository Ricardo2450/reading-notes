> ## [What is Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)

* Jupyter lab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.

* terminals on jupyter provide full support for system shells. 

* All popular image formats are supported as stand alone files.

* jupyter notebook has two modes command and edit.

* command mode is designed to easily navigating and changing the framework of your notebook.

* edit mode allows you to write up code or markdown all in the same notebook.

* In markdown you can still write code inline or use three back ticks and write the code in the middle of them. You can also create equations, typing a URL, or create a customized link.

* When creating code, all code is saved to the kernel used by the notebook. Meaning all variables are saved as if they were global. However, in order to ensure code is running as intended. Make sure each cell is run in the order they are intended other you will get errors.


> ## Numpy Tutorial

* NumPy can work with multidimensional arrays

* A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix

* In a NumPy array, the number of dimensions is called the rank, and each dimension is called an axis

* Can use indexing to assign values to certain elements in arrays

* A few important numpy data types:
  * float — numeric floating point data.
  * int — integer data.
  * string — character data.
  * object — Python objects.
