* use getStaticProps to fetch required data to render the index page.

* returned list must be an array of objects

* paths contains the array of known paths returned by getAllPostIds()

> ## [Next.js - Deployment](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app)

* Before you deploy, push your Next.js app to GitHub

* When deploying to vercel:
  * Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
  * Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.

* Vercel automatically creates a preview deployment for that branch on every push
