# The Growth Mindset

> ## Emotional intelligence

* First lets talk about my emotional intelligence. Its been a good journey ever since I started my Code Fellows journey. From the first time I took the emotional intelligence test, I have shown great improvement in self-awareness and self-management. With self-awareness, Im now able to reflect on my emotions at any given time. Before it was never like that. I would let my emotions kinda take over me or just give up with whatever task im doing. Now Im able to take a breath and slow things down for me to stop and really thing about what the issue is and how to solve it.

> ## Bias Self-Assessment
  
* I cant find or remember my last score. So I just did a new assessment. In this assessment, I have a few areas of growth like effective courage and four ways to act. I tend to improve in the areas I scored low on so it will help me within my next job position. However, I have many areas that are around the same score which makes me feel like Im really well rounded with bias. Even if im not, Having a growth mindset will really improve me to see things in ways I never thought of before to help better no only myself but the people around me.
