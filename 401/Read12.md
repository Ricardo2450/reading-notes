# Pandas

> ## [Pandas in 10](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html)

* Create a Series by passing a list of values and letting pandas create a default integer index

* Use DataFrame.head() and DataFrame.tail() to view the top and bottom rows of the frame.

* DataFrame.to_numpy() gives a NumPy representation of the underlying data. 

* use the isin() method for filtering.

* pandas primarily uses the value np.nan to represent missing data. It is by default not included in computations.

* Reindexing allows you to change/add/delete the index on a specified axis.

* DataFrame.apply() applies a user defined function to the data

* merge() enables SQL style join types along specific columns

* DataFrame as a way to store tabular data.

* .shape can be used to figure out how many rows and columns a dataset has.
