# Introduction to SQL

* The first few lesson I did, I felt great and thought it was going to be easy to finish. However, I was wrong. Once we got to the lesson's about really searching for specifics info. It was kind confusing at first. Also, the documentation was a little difficult to understand for me but I push through it with a little help from the website. After completing it. I would say I am a little more comfortable with trying to navigate around it all. Its definitely something that I will need to practice on more to get the hang of it. However, I feel like I would be able to help someone if asked to search through there SQL, even though it might take a minute. Overall, it was fun trying to find the right info through all that data. It be interesting to see what a real company SQL looks like and if I could search for something within all that.
