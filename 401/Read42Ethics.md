# Ethics in Tech

> ## [Microsoft and the DoD](https://web.archive.org/web/20200616232735/https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-employees-protest-contract-us-army-hololens-2019-2)

* The article I read was about a group of Microsoft employees demanding microsoft to cancel there contract with the DOD about the HoloLens augmented-reality technology. They state that they do not want to be "war profiteers" and had no intention to develop weapons of war. They also said that is just a huge scam to get the top execs to reap massive profits from military contracts. To which they say does not benefits them or any individual engineers working at these companies. I see where they are coming from but as someone who was in the military. I feel as if technology like this would greatly improve our military readiness to be ready for any war that may come. If the top execs would stop being greedy and take the massive profits and give it to the people who actually create the technology. Than everyone will be satisfied.

> ## [Ethical dilemma of self driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)

* In this article, It talked about the ethical dilemma of how a self driving car should behave in certain situations. Many people feel as if a car driving its self is unusual and don't like the feeling of not have total control. However, thats the future we are heading towards. So the question to ask than, how are we as humans going to be able to program these cars to behave as if we were in the front seat. How are we going to be able to tell a car what to do when its about to get in a car accident or avoid a person who stepped in front of it? Will it prioritize the human life inside the car or not? This is a topic I have never thought about but I feel the right thing to do is to prioritize minimum lose of life or damages.
