# React 1

> ## [ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview](https://www.taniarascia.com/es6-syntax-and-feature-overview/)

* arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression.

* Arrow functions do not have their own this, do not have prototypes, cannot be used for constructors, and should not be used as object methods.

* const keyword, which cannot be redeclared or reassigned, but is not immutable.

* let keyword, which allows for block-scoped variables which cannot be hoisted or redeclared.

> ## [React - Hello World](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)

* You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX

* Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute

* React elements are immutable.

* React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.
