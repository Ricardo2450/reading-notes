# Big O and Python name/values 

* A summery of all the videos, podcast, and articles I read for today. First lets start off with Big O. From my understanding Big O describes the worst-case scenario with performance or complexity of an algorithm. It uses an algorithm to see how well something preforms in terms of math. Honestly, Im still confused with understanding Big O as a whole. Even after reading and hearing about it. Im a visual person, so this new topic is hard for me to fully imagine but hopefully I can understand tomorrow in class. As for values in python. The video talked about how values work in python. For example, if we assigned x to the number 5. Than do y = x. Now change x to 10. Y is still going to equal 5 but x is now changed to 10. Same goes for list. When using a list, you are only using one list no matter how much you edit it or rename the value to the list. You are still using the single list and it never copies its self. You only can create a new list and so on. Thats what I took away from the video. Now all this is new to me and its frustrating to not understand everything right away but thats okay. As talked about in Pain and Suffering article, this pain is a way that will help me grow as a person to better understand this new subject. As long as I don't let my suffering take over me.
