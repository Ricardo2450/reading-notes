> ## Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

* One thing I feel like I can bring to this career is my ability to problem solve on the spot. With my experience of being a firefighter and have served in the navy. There have been countless times where I had to come up with a valid solution on the spot for very difficult situations. One that were even life threating. So I can take that experience and give back to the tech community.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* Take a deep breath and read the problem two or three times to really understand what is being asked.

* Break down the problem into smaller pieces till it becomes easy to understand and solve.

* If all else fails, use the resources I have available to me like my network, google, or youtube.
