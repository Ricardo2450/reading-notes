> ## Answers in the same order as questions.

* A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.

* An edge is a connection between two nodes.

* A graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

* A graph where every edge is directed.

* adjacency list

* weighted graph

* Cyclic graph

* node

* The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

* The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
