* Ask About Edge Cases

* Ask About Test Cases

* let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.

* ask if your pseudocode makes sense to the interviewer

* don’t hesitate to ask if your solution looks good

* If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally

* Ask if its ok to think about what you are going to solve than talk about it

* Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard

* Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode

* Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembering the small stuff. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities.

* Put in the time and come prepared.
