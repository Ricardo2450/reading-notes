# React 3

> ## [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started)

* Next.js can serve static assets

* Third-party JavaScript refers to any scripts that are added from a third-party source

* strategy controls when the third-party script should load. A value of lazyOnload tells Next.js to load this particular script lazily during browser idle time

* onLoad is used to run any JavaScript code immediately after the script has finished loading. In this example, we log a message to the console that mentions that the script has loaded correctly

> ## [React Context for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-context-for-beginners/)

* React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.

* Props drilling - when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

* benefit of the useContext hook is that it makes our components more concise and allows us to create our own custom hooks

* React context with a hook like useReducer and create a makeshift state management library without any third-party library, it is generally not recommended for performance reasons.
