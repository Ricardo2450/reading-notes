# _My reading notes for 102_

Hello :wave:

My Name is Ricardo Soto-Fabela. Some facts about me, Im a navy veteran and worked as a firefighter before joining code fellows. The reason why I'm taking this class is because a buddy recommend I get into coding after telling me how wonderful his experience working in the field is. So I did some reasearch and found Code Fellows was best for what I was looking for in a bootcamp. 


***What is Growth mindset?***

Growth mindset to me is the willingness to overcome challenges and improve yourself mentally. Simply by learning form any mistakes you make along the way.


***Three remindes to stay in a growth mind set:***
- Its okay to make mistakes when learning something new. We have to take baby steps first before we try to run.
- If your struggling to understand something. Walk away and take a break. Come back with a new way to possibly tackle the problem.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help or search something up using Google. We are humans and not computers.
