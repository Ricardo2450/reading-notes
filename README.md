# _My reading notes for 102_

Hello, My Name is Ricardo Soto-Fabela. Some facts about me, Im a navy veteran and worked as a firefighter before joining code fellows. The reason why I'm taking this class is because a buddy recommend I get into coding after telling me how wonderful his experience working in the field is. So I did some reasearch and found Code Fellows was best for what I was looking for in a bootcamp.
