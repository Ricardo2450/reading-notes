# Operators and Loops

> ***Expressions and operators***

* At a high level, an **expression** is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

* There are **two** types of expressions: 
  * those that have side effects (such as assigning values)
  * those that purely evaluate.

* **operators** join operands either formed by higher-precedence operators or one of the basic expressions.

Different type of operators to learn about:

* [Assignment operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#assignment_operators)
* [Comparison operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators)
* [Arithmetic operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#arithmetic_operators)
* [Bitwise operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bitwise_operators)
* [Logical operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#logical_operators)
* [BigInt operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#bigint_operators)
* [String operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#string_operators)
* [Conditional (ternary) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#conditional_ternary_operator)
* [Comma operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comma_operator)
* [Unary operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#unary_operators)
* [Relational operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#relational_operators)

> ***Loops and iteration***

* Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.

* Statements for loops provided in JavaScript are:

* [for statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#for_statement)
* [do...while statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#do...while_statement)
* [while statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#while_statement)
* [labeled statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#labeled_statement)
* [break statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#break_statement)
* [continue statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#continue_statement)
* [for...in statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#for...in_statement)
* [for...of statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration#for...of_statement)

***For statement***

* A 'for' loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.

* When a for loop executes, the following occurs:

  * The initializing expression initialExpression, if any, is executed. This expression usually initializes one or more loop counters, but the syntax allows an expression of any degree of complexity. This expression can also declare variables.
  * The conditionExpression expression is evaluated. If the value of conditionExpression is true, the loop statements execute. Otherwise, the for loop terminates. (If the conditionExpression expression is omitted entirely, the condition is assumed to be true.)
  * The statement executes. To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ }) to group those statements.
  * If present, the update expression incrementExpression is executed.
  * Control returns to Step 2.

***While statement***

* A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.

* If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.

* What happenes when you do a while loop?
  * The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops, and control is passed to the statement following while.
