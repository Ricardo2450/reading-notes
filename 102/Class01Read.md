# **Learning Markdown and GitHub**

In this assignment, I'm going to talk a little bit about the basic of markdown and github.

>**What is markdown**?

Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax aimed at making writing for the internet easier. One example of a basic syntax is to bold text. To do that, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters and than render your page. Its that easy! Now there are many more syntax that we can talk about but we would be here all day. Instead, you can click on the link below and read all about it on your free time.
