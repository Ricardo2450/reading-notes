# Structure web pages with HTML

>## [Wireframing](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/how-to-create-your-first-wireframe/)

**wireframing** - allows designers to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.

THese a different ways designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
Sketch > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

When building a wireframe, be mindful of these points:
-clarity
-confidence
-simplicity

 >## [HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics)

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) - is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content.

**Attributes** - contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.

\- An attribute should always have the following:

* A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).

* The attribute name followed by an equal sign.

* The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

\- \<!DOCTYPE html> — doctype. It is a required preamble.

\- \<html> element. This element wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.

\- \<head> element. This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.

\- \<title> element. This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in.

\- \<body> element. This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.

\- **Heading** elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. headings contain 6 leavels. 

\- Anything in HTML between <!-- and --> is an HTML comment. The browser ignores comments as it renders the code.

\- \<p> elements are for containing paragraphs of text

\- **Unordered lists** - are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter <ul>

\- **Ordered lists** - are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe. Ex. \<ol>

* Each item inside the lists is put inside an \<li> (list item) element.

\- \<a>  "a" - being the short form for "anchor". *To make text within your paragraph into a link*. Give the \<a> element an href attribute. ex. \<a href= "link">

\- href might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first.It stands for *hypertext reference*.

 > ## **Semantics**

 Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code

 Example, In HTML the \<h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of a header.
