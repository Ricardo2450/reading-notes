# **Design web pages with CSS**

> ***What is CSS***

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create,format,style your webpage. You have the power to control exactly how HTML elements look in the browser, presenting your markup using whatever design you like.

* Browsers - can sometimes be referred to as a user agent. Which basically means a computer program that represents a person inside a computer system.

* CSS is a rule-based language

> ***How to add CSS***

* There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

  * External CSS
  * Internal CSS
  * Inline CSS

* *External CSS* - external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

  * Note: HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

* *Internal CSS* - May be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. Its defined inside the \<style> element, inside the head section.

* *Inline CSS* - May be used to apply a unique style for a single element. It adds the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

* *Multiple Style Sheets* - You can have more than one style sheet in your code and the computer will still read it all. However, all the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, ***where number one has the highest priority***:

  * 1- Inline style (inside an HTML element)
  * 2- External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
  * 3- Browser default

So, an inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.
