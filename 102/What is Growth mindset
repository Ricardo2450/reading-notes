# ***What is Growth mindset***

Growth mindset to me is the willingness to overcome challenges and improve yourself mentally. Simply by learning form any mistakes you make along the way.

> ***Three remindes to stay in a growth mind set:***

- Its okay to make mistakes when learning something new. We have to take baby steps first before we try to run.
- If your struggling to understand something. Walk away and take a break. Come back with a new way to possibly tackle the problem.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help or search something up using Google. We are humans and not computers.
