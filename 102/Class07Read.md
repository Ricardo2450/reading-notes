> # MDN Control flow

* **Control flow** - the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

> ## Functions

* **JS Function** - Is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It's executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

* Defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

* Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

* The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

* You can reuse **Functions** as many times as you like once you define it once.

* To call a function you use (). Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.

* Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

* ***The code to be executed*** by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

* **Parameters** are listed inside the parentheses

* **Arguments** are the **values** received by the function when it is invoked.

* code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function like:
  * When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
  * When it is invoked (called) from  JavaScript code
  * Automatically (self invoked)

***Function Return***

* When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing. If it was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.

***Local Variables***

* Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

> ## JaveScript Operators

* **Assignment operator** (=) assigns a value to a variable.

* **Addition operator** (+) adds numbers:

* **Multiplication operator** (*) multiplies numbers.

* ***Types of JavaScript Operators***

  * Aritmetic Operators
  * Assignment Operators
  * Comparison Operators
  * Logical Operators
  * Conditional Operators
  * Type Operators

***Arithmetic operators***

* Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

\-Operator Description:

* \+  Addition
* \- Subtraction
* \* Multiplication
* ** Exponentiation (ES2016)
* / Division
* %  Modulus (Division Remainder)
* ++ Increment
* -- Decrement

***Assignment operators***

* Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

***Adding JavaScript Strings***

* The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.
