# React and Forms

> ## React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
   * An input form element whose value is controlled by React is called a “controlled component”. Like input, textarea, and select with a setstate.



2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
   * Better to wait till they sumbit the form because the user may accidentally set a value to undefined or null.

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
   * setstate()

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
   * Shorten your if statements into one line of code with the conditional operator

2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
   * answer: x===y ? 'true' : 'false';
