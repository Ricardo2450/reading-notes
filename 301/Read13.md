1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
   * CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands

2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
   * Figure out what you are creating first.
   * write all your post, get, delete, put code.
   * get a proof of life they work.
   * Once proof of life works, write in your code for your post, get, delete, and put to whatever you are creating.
   * test for proof of life again and connect to server.
